How Dan Winter went from not being able to walk without a From neurophysio.london</p>
<p>Lie on the floor “face upwards” and place a pillow under your forearm so that your arm may rest with a slight amount of stretch. This needs to be resolved by a medical professional. I can�t extend my arm after bicep/tricep workout. Stand straight on the ground with your feet close to each other and arms relaxed.</p>
<h3 id="i-warmed-up-and-cooled-down-aerobically-but-didn039t-do-any-real-stretching">I warmed up and cooled down aerobically, but didn�t do any real stretching.</h3><p>If anybody knows how to fix it throught workouts or exercises kindly help me out If you can’t straighten your arm after a workout it could be due to a condition or injury that has occurred. No one should pull or push on any of the movements of your joints. When you find you can’t physically move your elbow to straighten out your arm it is recommended that you have it assessed by a doctor, ignoring the issue could cause permanent damage. Inhale and lift your shoulders up towards your ears. This needs to be resolved by a medical professional.</p>

<p>I still get a pain sometimes when i reach to get something from a cupboard but am realising that has not been happening so much lately. You need to do the exercises but so worth it.

<p>Its like my arms are locked at 30 angle (bicep/tricep are tensed). So it’s not a quick process. Many doctors told me its not an ortheopedic problem.

<p>Best thing i can suggest when people get back into lifting is to work on muscular endurance for a couple weeks before anything else.

<p>Immediately there was intense pain and sudden inability to bend, straighten, or otherwise use the arm. More likely to be a musccle problem with shorter triceps.

Do not lift heavy objects with the affected arm.</p>

<p>The bad news is that it may take a few years to fully straighten out. If you’re experiencing worse than just normal muscle soreness see a doctor.
