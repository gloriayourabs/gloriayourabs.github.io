<p>Yes, i watched these videos while lying on the sofa and snacking on a bag of chips.

<p>Chloe ting definitely kicked it up a notch this week and introduced some of the harder videos. And i, like many other viewers, belonged to the “passive audience” community. I want to start her summer shred 2019 program soon, although i hope it won�t be too much because my fitness level is quite low i�d say 😂 but i�m curious.</p>

<p>Everyone knows (if they dont, they should) that exercise is supplementary to an appropriate diet for weight loss. It also included a couple of active rest days for you to take off or enjoy something like a walk or yoga.
