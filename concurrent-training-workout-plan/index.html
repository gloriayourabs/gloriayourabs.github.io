<p>Key points to remembers when programming your concurrent training program: For example, if you do a skill practice, lift weights and go for a run, then repeat these efforts throughout the week, you are training concurrently. Separate training modes with over 8 hours of recovery. Taken together, these observations suggest that coaches and athletes should be careful when concurrent training.</p>
