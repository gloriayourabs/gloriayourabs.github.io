<p>The ‘heavy duty’ workout routine. Zap did not include a reps goal. The exercises of choice are usually solid compound movements. Once you get adjusted with the weight you’re lifting, try to increase it within this rep range.</p>
<h3 id="i-tried-for-4-weeks-heavy-duty-results-are-intresting-3-workouts-for-week-30-minuts-of-workout-i-gain-1kg-i-was-in-better-shape-i-gain-chestback-and-legs">I tried for 4 weeks heavy duty results are intresting 3 workouts for week 30 minuts of workout i gain 1kg i was in better shape i gain chest,back and legs</h3><p>Here�s a sample chest, shoulder, and triceps workout: This means 4 seconds on the eccentric (positive), a 2 second hold or squeeze at the top and then slow and controlled on the concentric (negative) portion over 4 seconds. As for taking five to seven days of rest between workouts, as mentzer advocated later in his career, the benefits are less clear. Divide your body parts into two workouts and allow 48 hours between workouts. Add ec to this one (you know you want to). A heavy duty workout should be relatively short, but the intensity must be taken to the ultimate limit.</p>
