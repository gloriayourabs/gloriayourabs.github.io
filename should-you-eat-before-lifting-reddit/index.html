<p>I personally eat my 800kcal breakfast, do the dishes, then head to the gym. If you are on a diet, you may lose fat slower. Poor sleep may make you gain fat and lose muscle mass.

<p>If i want to maintain muscle mass in a calorie deficit, how many grams of protein should i aim for each day to eventually get to ~20% bf? Poor sleep may make you gain fat and lose muscle mass.

<p>Buuuut back when i was lifting first thing in the morning (which was also when i was doing nrolfw!), i dealt with it by having a really (really) big dinner the night before.

<p>As for me, i like having a very watery protein shake before my workouts, especially on leg day so that the muscles are rebuilding as they are breaking. If it helps you can take your tdee and multiply it by 7. Usually, this happens if you have a physical job just before working out then going for a 2h workout,.</p>
