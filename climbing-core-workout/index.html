<p>2 times a week i do planks, side planks, back planks, arch holds, hollow holds, l sits, mountain climbers (but with my feet in rings, not sure if that is the right name for the exercise), and russian twists. The one exception which may be specific to climbing is the hanging leg raise and its variations. Using your core, roll your shoulders to the right.
