<p>This month not only does the intensity go up a bit the minutes of each workout go up a bit to 60 minutes each day. Throw in real heavy lift days at least once a week. A lot of month 2 intervals recruits your entire body. I felt like i was constantly doing push ups.</p>
<h3 id="month-2-for-me-never-got-easier-but-i-was-able-to-do-it-and-not-take-as-many-breaks-as-the-weeks-went-on">Month 2, for me, never got easier but i was able to do it and not take as many breaks as the weeks went on.</h3><p>That will be based on that first time going through it. Month 2 workouts seemed more resistance oriented than the month 1 workouts. The workouts are shorter on average in the beginning. Have gotten great results with fast &amp; slow twitch muscle. Started insanity 2 weeks ago and i have dropped a inch already in pants. Month 1 has its own list of workouts that you alternate between each week, while month 2 has similar yet more difficult versions of those same workouts.</p>

<p>I felt like i was constantly doing push ups. This was a hard month. We both used to regularly lift weights in the gym, about 4 days per week, but have had to stop when our gym closed during the pandemic.

<p>This is my first time ever doing insanity, but my boyfriendï¿½s second (itï¿½s been a while). The insanity calendar is split into two months with a recovery week in between.

<p>The schedule allows for one rest day per week and one cardio recovery day. Now, i still have about 30 lbs to lose and i donât know which program to do. The truth is that itâs not. The insanity workout are tough, but it will still take some until you see any results at all. Of course some results are.</p>
