<p>Ideally, if you�re lifting weights after eating first thing in the morning, you will need to get up and chow down about 30 to 60 minutes before exercising. You should wait 2 hours after eating to exercise. How soon after your workout you need to eat depends on the intensity of your workout and ranges from 15 minutes to 2.</p>

<p>What duration would be most optimal? After 15 minutes your breath and heart rate will be back at normal levels again, so it will be the perfect time to.

<p>If i’m eating big meal, like a whole dinner, i usually wait 1.5+ hours. In these cases, you should eat a snack that could replace the glycogen stores in your body quickly.
